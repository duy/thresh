* repo structure refactoring
 * the django project (thresh) should be an example project (or submodule) instead of the root directory of the django application (main)
 * requirements.txt should be in the directory above the django application
 * mv this TODO to the directory above the django application
 * create setup.py for the application

* django-registration-templates: fork it and create setup.py so it can be just installed with the requirements instead of having a git submodule

* bugs
 * index.html shows "log in" instead of "logged in" after being logged in
